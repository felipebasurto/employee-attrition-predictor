        "    * You can save some data from the training set to use as a validation set, but you should not use the test set for this purpose.\n",

        "    * The CSV file that you will submit, should contain the predictions of your model on the test set. This means that the CSV should contain as many rows as the test set, and a single column with the predictions (0 or 1)."
